# Real estate case study. 

Time to practice thinking like a Data Scientist. 

Read the case study intro in DDS Ch 2. 

Your "CEO" report should be it's own self-contained R Markdown file. 

You'll want to "pretty" it up by 
- hiding all code and unnecessary output
- using kable, pander or other nice formatting functions on all visible output
- using consistent themes for all plots (and getting rid of that horrible gray ggplot background)
- set fig.height and fig.width options so that your plots don't take up the entire page. 

This means you need to keep your data management and playground analysis code files separate. 

By the due date, this repo should contain: 

1. A data management file that reads in the raw data and transforms it into an analysis format. 
2. That analysis formatted data set saved as a .Rdata file
3. A playground code file (.R or .Rmd, your choice)
4. The final report, as a .Rmd file that is compiled to a PDF (5-7 pages max). 

You will work with a partner on this assignment. 

* A single assignment repository will be assigned to each analysis team
* The `main` branch is for your final report.
* All work should be done on individual student branches, and merged into the main branch when a feature is complete.
