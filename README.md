# Case Study EDA. 

Time to practice thinking like a Data Scientist. 
Read the case study intro in DDS Ch 2. 

Your "CEO" report should be it's own self-contained R Markdown file. 
You'll want to "pretty" it up by 
- hiding all code and unnecessary output
- using kable, pander or other nice formatting functions on all visable output
- using consistent themes for all plots (and getting rid of that horrible gray ggplot background)
- set fig.height and fig.width options so that your plots don't take up the entire page. 

This means you need to keep your data management and playground analysis code files separate. 

By the due date, this repo should contain: 

1. A data management file that reads in the raw data and transforms it into an analysis format. 
2. That analysis formatted data set saved as a .Rdata file
3. A playground code file (.R or .Rmd, your choice)
4. The final report, as a .Rmd file that can be compiled to a PDF. 

Separately you are to actually print this PDF report and turn in a hard copy. 
This helps you to ensure that it looks good, and isn't too lengthy.

5-7 pages max. 

You can work with others on this assignment, but all writing must be your own.
